Stairs

(Poem to be read from the last line)

                                                                                                 Stairs stare
                                                                                          Torrential pain
                                                                                And pain returns
                                                                         I will make it
                                                                Rallying on
                                                       Stand strong

                                                                         Stairs sigh at me
                                                                     The angels abandon
                                                                  A crucifix I hold
                                                               I pray a miracle
                                                          Reeling in pain
                                                      Saviour Oh come to me
                                                                                               
                                                   Stairs mock at me
                                               The blues tighten
                                           And perhaps not
                                      I must get there
                               Resolving to get up
                        Struggling terribly

                                             Still staring at the stairs
                                          Too bad Iâ€™m still there
                                       At last there is no one left
                                    I am still at the start
                                Reaching out shaking             
                            Somehow never there

                        Still to reach the top
                    Tears like rivulets  
               A step at a time
          I still have to climb
     Rising melancholy
Staring hard
